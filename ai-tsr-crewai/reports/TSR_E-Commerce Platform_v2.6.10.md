## Variances/Deviations


### Test Execution Variances

- **Pass Rate Deviation** (Medium): Pass rate of 62.5% is significantly below expected threshold
  - **Impact**: Quality concerns may indicate widespread issues
  - **Mitigation**: Conduct root cause analysis and implement quality gates

- **Critical Defect Deviation** (Critical): 1 critical defect(s) found - release blocker
  - **Impact**: Critical functionality is compromised, release should be delayed
  - **Mitigation**: Immediate defect resolution and re-testing required

- **Flaky Test Deviation** (Medium): 1 flaky test(s) identified: TC010
  - **Impact**: Unreliable test results may mask real issues
  - **Mitigation**: Investigate and fix flaky tests to improve reliability
