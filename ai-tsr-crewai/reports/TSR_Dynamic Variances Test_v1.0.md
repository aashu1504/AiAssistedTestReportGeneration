## Variances/Deviations


### Test Execution Variances

- **Pass Rate Deviation** (Medium): Pass rate of 50.0% is significantly below expected threshold
  - **Impact**: Quality concerns may indicate widespread issues
  - **Mitigation**: Conduct root cause analysis and implement quality gates

- **Critical Defect Deviation** (Critical): 1 critical defect(s) found - release blocker
  - **Impact**: Critical functionality is compromised, release should be delayed
  - **Mitigation**: Immediate defect resolution and re-testing required

- **Module Defect Density Deviation** (High): High defect density in modules: Authentication, Notifications, Reports, Search, User Management
  - **Impact**: Specific modules show excessive defect rates
  - **Mitigation**: Focus additional testing and development effort on high-defect modules

- **Module Pass Rate Deviation** (Medium): Low pass rates in modules: Authentication
  - **Impact**: Specific modules show poor quality indicators
  - **Mitigation**: Review and improve test cases for low-performing modules
